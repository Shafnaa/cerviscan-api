ðŸ“Œ YUV Color Moment Feature Extraction (Python)
============================================

Description:
------------
This program extracts statistical color moment features (mean, standard deviation,
and skewness) from images in the YUV color space. The YUV representation separates
luminance (Y) from chrominance (U and V), which can improve performance in tasks
where brightness and color variations need to be analyzed independently.

Features:
---------
âœ… Converts RGB images into YUV color space using a standard transformation matrix
âœ… Extracts first three color moments (mean, standard deviation, skewness)
âœ… Works on all images that can be opened using Pillow (e.g., .png, .jpg, .jpeg)
âœ… Provides both feature values and corresponding feature names

Usage:
------
1. Provide the path to the input image file.
2. Call the `get_yuv_color_moment_features(image_path)` function to extract features.
3. Use `get_yuv_color_moment_feature_names()` to retrieve the ordered feature labels.
4. Features can be used for tasks such as image classification, retrieval, or clustering.

Example:
--------
features = get_yuv_color_moment_features("sample.jpg")
feature_names = get_yuv_color_moment_feature_names()

print(dict(zip(feature_names, features)))

        Extract color moment features from an image in the YUV color space.

        This function converts an RGB image to the YUV color space using a standard
        conversion matrix. It then computes the first three color moments: mean,
        standard deviation, and skewness for each of the Y, U, and V channels.

        Parameters
        ----------
        image_path : str
            Path to the image file.

        Returns
