============================================
ðŸ“Œ Single Image Feature Extraction (Python)
============================================

Description:
------------
This program extracts multiple color moment and texture features from a single
segmented image. It is designed for website or application use cases where
features from individual images are required for tasks such as image
classification, clustering, or retrieval.

The extracted features include color moments from different color spaces (RGB, YUV, LAB)
and several texture features (GLRLM, TAMURA, LBP). The program returns the
results as a Pandas DataFrame for easy integration into data analysis or machine
learning pipelines.

Features:
---------
âœ… Supports extraction of color moments from RGB, YUV, and LAB color spaces
âœ… Supports multiple texture descriptors: LBP, GLRLM, TAMURA
âœ… Flexible selection of feature types (color spaces and texture methods)
âœ… Outputs results as a clean Pandas DataFrame
âœ… Automatically removes constant-valued columns

Usage:
------
1. Import the `SingleImageFeatureExtractor` class.
2. Initialize the extractor: `extractor = SingleImageFeatureExtractor()`.
3. Call `extractor.extract_features(image_path)` with the path to the input image.
4. (Optional) Specify desired color spaces or texture feature sets.

Example:
--------
segmented_path = "path/to/segmented_image.png"
extractor = SingleImageFeatureExtractor()
image_features = extractor.extract_features(segmented_path)
print(image_features)
