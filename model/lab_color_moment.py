ðŸ“Œ LAB Color Moment Feature Extraction (Python)
============================================

Description:
------------
This program extracts **color moment features** from images in the LAB color space.
Color moments are statistical measures (mean, standard deviation, skewness) that
summarize the color distribution of an image. They are widely used in image
processing, computer vision, and machine learning tasks such as image retrieval,
classification, and object recognition.

Features:
---------
âœ… Converts images to LAB color space using scikit-image
âœ… Computes mean, standard deviation, and skewness for each LAB channel
âœ… Returns features as a list for easy integration with ML pipelines
âœ… Includes a helper function to provide descriptive feature names

Usage:
------
1. Provide an image path as input to `get_lab_color_moment_features()`.
2. The function will return a list of 9 extracted features.
3. Use `get_lab_color_moment_feature_names()` to get the ordered names
   corresponding to the extracted features.

Example:
--------
features = get_lab_color_moment_features("sample_image.jpg")
feature_names = get_lab_color_moment_feature_names()

print(dict(zip(feature_names, features)))
